            <p>A desktop or web application that simulates the behavior and interaction of nanomachines inside a human body. 
                The app uses algorithms to mimic biological reactions, decision-making AI for adaptive healing,
                and visualization tools to display real-time simulation results.</p>

            <p>A security-focused project that explores how nanomachines can create a decentralized, microscopic firewall or 
                anti-virus inside data networks. The project could use blockchain-inspired distributed checks and AI-powered 
                threat detection algorithms to simulate a 'nanomachine swarm' protecting the system.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Ashim Thapa.<br>
            I am currently based in Ontario, Canada, and I have a background in Computer Programming Diploma. 
            Over the years, I have developed skills in web development, backend programming, frontend design, and project documentation, with hands-on
            experience in various academic and personal projects using MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express, Angular, Node.js), C#/.NET, and basic web technologies
            like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
            Professionally, I have worked in roles such as Correctional Officer, Concierge, Security Officer, Warehouse Worker, and Respite Worker (2 years), which helped me develop strong communication, problem-solving, teamwork, leadership, and crisis 
            management skills.<br>
            My interests extend into areas like AI, nanotechnology, speculative fiction, manhwa, game development, high-risk financial
            strategies, and wellness technology, and I am constantly exploring how to blend coding, system design, creative writing, and user-centric thinking
            with futuristic and innovative concepts.<br>
            Currently, I am seeking opportunities where I can contribute to meaningful projects, expand my skills 
            in IT and software development, work in a team-driven environment, and explore creative programming applications, while also improving my financial
            stability, achieving personal growth, and contributing to projects that can empower communities like adolescent wellness platforms and system-driven
        applications.</p>
